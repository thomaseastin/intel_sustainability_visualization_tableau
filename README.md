# Introduction
Intel, the semiconductor manufacturing powerhouse, is planning on building a new data center. Energy availability and usage are some of the key considerations Intel weighs when deciding where to construct a new data center. For example, which regions produce a surplus of energy, and are therefore more likely to provide energy at cheaper prices?  Which regions rely more on renewable energy sources?

In this project, co-designed with Intel's Sustainability Team, I was tasked with building dashboards and visualizations that provided the team at Intel with the best data-driven recommendations for where the optimal location for a new data center was. 

Before getting started, lets familiarize oursleves with some important terms in the data.

### Data Terms

Balancing Authority - A Balancing Authority is responsible for maintaining the electricity balance within its region. This is a company that makes sure electricity is being exchanged between electric providers and regions so that no region runs out of electricity due to high demand.

**Data Date** - The date the energy was produced.

**Local Time at End of Hour** - The time after energy was generated, .e.g., energy generated between 1pm-2pm will show up as 2pm in this field.

**Demand** - The energy demand on the grid (what the houses/business are using).

**Net Generation** - The energy produced in the region by all sources e.g., wind, coal, nuclear, etc.

**All Petroleum Products** - Energy generated from petroleum sources.

**Energy Source** - The source of the energy produced, e.g., petroleum, solar, wind, etc.

**Percent Difference** - A calculated field, created for you by the Intel team, that shows the change in energy based on the fields in the visualization.

**Region** - The electric service area within a geographic area of the USA. e.g. California, Midwest, etc.

NW - Northwest
CENT - Central
CAL - California
TEX - Texas
NY - New York
MIDW - Midwest
SW - South West
TEN - Tennessee
NE - North East
SE - South East
MIDA - Mid-Atlantic
CAR - Central America Region
